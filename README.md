### üìä Human Activity Recognition Datasets

This project supports a range of publicly available datasets commonly used in human activity recognition (HAR) research. 
Below is a brief overview of each dataset, ordered from general-purpose to specialized applications:

#### üìÅ [USC-HAD](https://sipi.usc.edu/had/)
- **Description**: A basic HAR dataset collected from 14 subjects performing 12 daily activities such as walking, sitting, and jumping.
- **Modality**: Body-worn accelerometer and gyroscope
- **Annotations**: 12 labeled activities (Walking, Running, Jumping, Sitting, Standing, Lying Down, Climbing Stairs, Descending Stairs, Bicycling, Elliptical Trainer, Rowing Machine, and Jump Rope)

#### üìÅ [Capture-24](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:99d7c092-d865-4a19-b096-cc16440cd001)
- **Description**: A free-living dataset collected from 151 participants wearing wrist-mounted accelerometers for 24 hours. Ground truth labels were obtained via wearable cameras and diaries.
- **Modality**: Wrist-worn 3-axis accelerometer (Axivity AX3)
- **Annotations**: Activity labels such as sleep, walking, sitting, standing, etc.

#### üìÅ [Opportunity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/opportunity+activity+recognition)
- **Description**: A rich multimodal dataset collected in a sensorized environment using wearable, object, and ambient sensors.
- **Modality**: IMUs, accelerometers, magnetic sensors, ambient sensors
- **Annotations**: 5 activity labels (Preparing Coffee, Cleaning, Relaxing, Cooking, and Eating)

#### üìÅ [OpenPack](https://open-pack.github.io/)
- **Description**: A multimodal dataset capturing packing tasks in industrial settings. Includes wearable sensors, depth cameras, and IoT signals.
- **Modality**: IMUs, RGB-D cameras, 2D/3D keypoints, IoT triggers
- **Annotations**: 10 work operation labels (Picking, Relocate Item Label, Assemble Box, Insert Items, Close Box, Attach Box Label, Scan Label, Attach Shipping Label, Put on Back Table, and Fill out Order)
  
#### üìÅ [ParkinsonGait (Freezing of Gait Dataset)](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/r8gmbtv7w2/3)
- **Description**: A multimodal dataset for detecting Freezing of Gait (FoG) in patients with Parkinson's Disease. Includes clinical annotations and sensor recordings.
- **Modality**: EEG, IMUs, physiological signals
- **Annotations**: FoG episodes and walking phases
